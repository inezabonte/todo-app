- This is a simple todo app that I made. It allows you to do simple CRUD operations;
  - Create new tasks +
  - Check ✅ completed tasks
  - edit tasks 📝
  - Delete tasks 🚮

## **How to run locally**

- `Clone this repository`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` - The app will authomatically start from port 3000. You can change this in the `webpack.congig.js` file.
